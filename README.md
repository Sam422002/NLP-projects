# NLP-projects
A collection of Natural Language Processing (NLP) projects using Python, covering text preprocessing, Word2Vec, topic modeling, sentiment analysis, and more.
# üß† NLP Projects

This repository contains a collection of hands-on Natural Language Processing (NLP) projects built using Python libraries like NLTK, SpaCy, Gensim, and scikit-learn. Each project focuses on a specific technique or application in NLP ‚Äî from text preprocessing and word embeddings to sentiment analysis and topic modeling.

## üìÅ Project List

- **Text Preprocessing Pipeline**  
  Clean and tokenize text using NLTK, remove stopwords, and prepare corpora.

- **Word2Vec from Game of Thrones**  
  Train custom word embeddings on Game of Thrones scripts using Gensim‚Äôs Word2Vec. Visualize in 2D/3D using PCA and t-SNE.

- **Sentiment Analysis on Movie Reviews**  
  Apply machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes) on IMDb dataset for sentiment classification.

- **Topic Modeling with LDA**  
  Perform unsupervised topic extraction from news articles using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA).

- **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**  
  Extract names of people, places, and organizations using SpaCy.

- **Text Classification**  
  Build a classification model to categorize documents into topics (e.g., news categories, product reviews).
